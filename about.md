I am a Software Developer with a passion for programming and a lot of admiration
for human languages.

In my free time, I am actively working to strengthen my skills in Rust, Go, C
and related technologies

At this blog, I document my learning experiences, share my progress, thoughts,
options and knowledge in the hope that it will help others on their journey.

Welcome!
