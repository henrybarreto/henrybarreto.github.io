title: About
---

I am a software developer specializing in Back-end development, with a keen
interest in networking programming and ensuring seamless interoperability within
programming languages.

I'm fascinated by the idea that our native languages shape not only how we
communicate, but also how we perceive the world around us. This concept intrigues
me greatly and drives my exploration of human language.

In my free time, I am actively working to strengthen my skills in Rust, Go, and
C, improving my English reading, listening, and speaking, and getting a bit of
German for fun.

In this blog, I document my learning experiences, sharing my thoughts, opinions,
and knowledge in the hope that it will help others on their journey.
